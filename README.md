This website is a small restaurant booking system. Here are two Microservices: Guest and Table. The Guest registers and check if a table is free. If a table is available it is assigned for the Guest otherwise it gives an error message.

This website is built with react frontend and springboot backend.

Springboot backend works with Postgres database. The interaction is shown here:
